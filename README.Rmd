# purrrays

Purrrays is designed to make working with R arrays easier, particularly arrays
with more than two dimensions arrays. Purrrays has no dependancies, but it is
inspired by and designed to work well with the packages purrr, magrittr, and
zeallot.

## Installation

purrrays is not on CRAN yet. You can install the development version from github with

``` r
devtools::install_github("t-kalinowski/purrrays")
```

The package provides:

*  A family of functions for spliting, binding, and modifying multi-dimensional
arrays. 

    +  `split_on_dim()` takes an array and returns a list.
    
    +  `bind_on_dim()` and `bind_as_dim()` take a list and return a single array.
    
    +  `modify_along_dim()` takes an array, calls the passed function `.f()` on
    each subset of the specified dimension, and returns an array of the same
    shape.
    
    +  All the functions have two varients `*_rows()` and `*_cols()` for the two
    most common cases of the 1st and 2nd dimension. For example
    `split_on_rows()` and `split_on_cols()`, which are equivalent to
    `split_on_dim(X, 1)` and `split_on_dim(X, 2)`
   

*  A family of lower-level helpers that abstract out patterns commonly
encountered while working with arrays, for example `seq_along_rows()` (a
combination of `seq_along()` and `nrow()`, with some error checks for common
pitfalls).

*  Many of the functions are agnostic about the number of dimensions in the array
passed. In practice, this means that you can use the same code path for arrays
of various sizes. For example, to extract `idx` on the 1st dimension, you can use
`extract_rows(X, idx)`, and it will work for an array of any number of
dimensions. Contrast this with the base alternative `X[idx,,]`, where you have
to modify the number of commas `,` to match the number of dimensions in `X`. 

*  Many of the functions work recursively if provided a list of arrays. This is
particularly useful in combination with ``` zeallot::`%<-%`() ``` multi-assignment
operator, which allows for patterns like:
``` R
c(X, Y) %<-% shuffle_rows(X, Y, in_sync = TRUE)
```

*  A set of functions that help encode atomic vectors as `onehot()` binary
matrix's and `decode_onehot()` back into atomic vectors.

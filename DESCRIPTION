Description: A toolbox for working with R arrays in a functional programming style. It offers
    a family of functions for flexibly splitting, binding, modifying, and subsetting
    arrays, as well as a handful of lower-level helpers that abstract out patterns
    commonly encountered while working with arrays. The majority of the
    functions are agnostic about the number of dimensions in the provided array and
    work recursively, enabling operations on multiple arrays to be performed
    synchronously. Listarrays has no dependencies, but it is designed to work well
    with the packages purrr and magrittr.

Description: A toolbox for working with R arrays in a functional programming style. The core
    feature is a family of functions for flexibly splitting an array into lists of
    smaller arrays and combining a list of arrays into a single array. It also
    provides a set of lower-level helpers that abstract out patterns commonly
    encountered while working with arrays, as well as pipe-friendly and more
    flexible versions of `dim<-`() and `dimnames<-`(). The majority of the functions
    are agnostic about the number of dimmensions in the provided array and work
    recursively, enabling operations on multiple arrays to be performd synchronysly.
    Listarrays has not dependancies, but it is designed to work well with the
    packages purrr and magrittr.
